I'm starting to learn Git as a junior dev. It will help me manage repos easily and learn other tools faster.

No need for every command now. I'll learn basics first, then more as I work on projects. Here's my simple cheat sheet:

git innit - intialize a git repo
git clone <repo url>  - clone a git repo
git add <file> - add unstracked or unstaged changes
git commit -m 'message' - make a commit
git status - check what you added
git push - push the current branch to its remote
git pull - fetch changes and merge
git fetch - fetch changes but don't merge
git config user.name 'Your Name' - set a config option
